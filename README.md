**GPT-instructions**

First, you need to download some files from a website. You can find the link to the files here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AvzEsnT6yIJovCCK1rqAXiIG4meB?e=bmydUt

After you download the files, you need to "unzip" them. This just means you need to open up the files so you can use them.

Next, you need to click on a file called "run server sync.bat" and then right-click on it. A menu will pop up and you should click "edit."

A window will pop up with some words in it. You need to copy a line of text that looks like this: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202\bin\java.exe

Then, you need to paste that line of text into your file explorer window. This will take you to a special folder on your computer.

If you see some files in that folder, then you can create a shortcut for "run server sync.bat" and put it on your desktop. This makes it easy to find and use.

If you don't see any files in that folder, then you need to look for another folder on your computer called "Java." It should be in your C drive, in a folder called "Program Files."

Once you find the "Java" folder, look for a folder called "jdk1.8.0_202" and then look for a folder called "bin." Copy the path to that folder.

Go back to the "run server sync.bat" file and replace the old text with the new text you just copied. Make sure to add "/java.exe" after "bin".

Next, you need to go to your Minecraft folder. You can find it by searching for "%appdata%" in your file explorer. Look for a folder called ".minecraft" and open it up.

Drag the "server sync" file and the "run server sync.bat" file into a blank forge folder running 1.12.2.

Finally, click on the "run server sync.bat" file and enter the server IP address (it should be a number, like 123.45.67.89) and the port number it should 38067.

That's it! Whenever you want to play on the server, just click on the "run server sync.bat" file, press "sync," and then launch Minecraft and connect to the server.

once the file is downloaded unzip it and go thorugh the java installer.

After, click on "run server sync.bat" so it is highlighted and then right click it. A dialogue box will appear and you need to click edit.

You will see "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202\bin\java.exe" -jar serversync-4.1.0.jar.

Copy C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202\bin\java.exe and paste that into your file explorer window.

If the path is correct then you are fine to create a shortcut for "Run Server Synce.bat" and put it on your desktop.

If the path is invalid then you will need to check for where the install path is. Go to your c drve and check program files (NOT X86) and look for a folder called java.

Once you find that folder click on it and then look for the java version 202, after click on the bin and then copy the path.

Go onto the bat file from ealier and replace C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202\bin\ with the path you have. MAKE SURE TO PUT java.exe after bin\

Then go to your minecraft directory, search %appdata% in your file explorer and look for .minecraft.

Drag the server sync file and run server sync file in a new forge folder running minecraft 1.12.2.

Once done, click on the "Run Server Sync.bat" and enter the server ip and port 38067 in their respective areas.

Thats it, whenever you want to play the server run the bat file and press sync and then launch minecraft and connect to the server.
